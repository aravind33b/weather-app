# weather-app
Created a weather app to show both weekly and hourly forecast. User can toggle between Celsius and Farenheit while checking the temperature.
Used React.js, CSS and openweathermap's APIs to fetch the hourly forecast data and displayed it on UI.

Utilised Props to transfer state variables from the main weather.js component to hourlyforecast.js component.

To run the application in your local system, follow the steps below:
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Run npm i and then npm start
